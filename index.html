      <h2>Built on Fundamentals</h2>
      <p>
        We are not structured like a traditional private equity firm. There are no leverage-driven exits,
        no short-term horizons, and no financial engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, we focus on direct involvement in operations, continuous learning, and building value
        through disciplined execution over many years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The model is simple: own businesses we understand, improve them with care and competence,
        and hold them indefinitely as part of a permanent group.

          <h3>Operator-First</h3>
          <p>
            We lead from the inside. Our understanding comes from direct involvement in the work,
            not financial modeling alone.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Long-Term Ownership</h3>
          <p>
            Companies are held indefinitely. The goal is compounding value through patient execution,
            not quick exits.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Continuous Learning</h3>
          <p>
            Every business is a learning opportunity. We document what works, refine processes,
            and improve over time.
